# W19 + W20 CartPole Mini Project

Train a reinforcement learning agent to balance a pole, then prove your improvements with evidence.

---

## What You're Building

A complete ML experimentation workflow:

```
Week 19: Train baseline → Learn PR workflow → Tune hyperparameters → Submit best config
Week 20: Package for reproducibility → Get reviewed → Run A/B test → Make final decision
```

---

## Your Team Roles

Assign these on Day 1 and write them in `docs/runbook.md`:

## Quick Start (Do This First)

### Using Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Click any `.ipynb` file in this repo
2. Click **"Open in Colab"** button (or File → Open in Colab)
3. Run cells top to bottom
4. Save your work: **File → Save a copy to GitHub**

### Using Local Python (Optional)

```bash
# Check Python version (must be 3.10+)
python --version

# Install packages
pip install gymnasium stable-baselines3 tensorboard optuna

# IMPORTANT: Run notebooks from the notebooks/ directory
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook W19D1_baseline.ipynb
```

## W19D1 — Train Your Baseline

**Goal:** Get a working PPO agent and agree on how you'll measure success.

### Step-by-Step

| Step | Action                                             | Where          |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Open `notebooks/W19D1_baseline.ipynb`              | GitHub → Colab |
| 2    | Run all cells (takes ~5-10 min)                    | Colab          |
| 3    | Write down your mean reward (e.g., "Mean: 245.3")  | Notebook output|
| 4    | Open `docs/eval_protocol.md` and fill in as a team | GitHub         |
| 5    | Open `docs/runbook.md` and assign team roles       | GitHub         |
| 6    | Post your baseline mean to Canvas                  | Canvas         |

# 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Colab disconnects | Save frequently with File → Save to GitHub |
| "Module not found" | Run the install cell at the top again |
| Notebook won't open in Colab | Try: File → Open notebook → GitHub tab → paste repo URL |
| PR can't be merged | Check for merge conflicts, resolve them |
| Results look wrong | Check your seed matches the protocol |
