# W20D4 Experiment Results (Andrea)

## Comparison
- A (Baseline): W19 baseline configuration
- B (Ship Candidate): results/best_config.json

## Data
Results will be stored in:
`results/final_eval.csv`

(Currently template only — runs pending or handled by Runner role.)

## Decision
Status: ITERATE (pending full A/B evaluation)

## Reasoning
The ship candidate was selected based on HPO performance and stability,
but final statistical comparison requires multiple seeded runs.

## Notes
This document reflects the experiment structure and decision framework
outlined in `docs/experiment_brief_andrea.md`.
