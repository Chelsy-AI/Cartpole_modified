# Contribution Plan (W19)

Tashoy requested PR
Reviewer is Andrea Churchwell
All changes will be made on a branch → pushed → opened as a Pull Request → reviewed by at least one teammate → merged into main.
Only the Maintainer merges PRs into main to prevent conflicts and keep main stable.


## Branching Rules
- We will not commit directly to `main`.
- Each change will be made in a separate branch.
- Branch naming format:
  - `feature/<name>-<short-description>`
  - `docs/<name>-update`

## Pull Request Workflow
1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make a small change (code, docs, or results)
3. Commit with a clear message
4. Push branch to GitHub
5. Open a PR into `main`
6. Request review from at least one teammate
7. Address feedback (if needed)
8. Merge PR after approval

## Review Expectations
- Each PR must receive at least 1 review before merging.
- Reviewers will leave at least one comment (approval or suggestion).
- PR authors should respond to comments and update the PR if changes are needed.

## Merge Rules
- The Maintainer is responsible for merging PRs into `main`.
- PRs should only be merged when CI checks pass (if applicable) and the PR is approved.

## Results / Evidence Rules
- Any training or HPO run must commit artifacts into `results/`.
- Required artifacts include:
  - `results/hpo_leaderboard.csv`
  - `results/best_config.json`
- Key metrics (baseline and best mean reward) must be documented in:
  - `docs/eval_protocol.md`
  - `docs/ship_candidate.md`

## Conflict Handling
- If a merge conflict happens, the PR author will pull latest `main`,
  resolve the conflict locally, and push an updated branch.
